Step 1: Get Url From prometheus.io Lastest Version.
Step 2: By using wget to download the package
Step 3: unzip prometheus package by using of unzip command
Step 4: Check for all updates using command – “sudo apt update -y” 
Step 5: Navigate to prometheus and copy “prometheus” & “promtool” to /usr/local/bin.
Step 6: Start PROMETHEUS process using “./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml"
Step 7: Verify by entering <IP_ADDRESS:9090> in the Browser as below : 3.135.194.87:9090
Step 8: Change <IP_ADDRESS:9090>/metrics to check the available metrics of the host
INSTALLATION OF NODE EXPORTER
1. Login to UBUNTU machine (Depending upon your requirement create the number of servers)
For better understanding, create more than 2 servers for Assessment. 
2. Follow same steps – Login as ROOT user and check for updates. 
3. Navigate to NODE EXPORTER in https://prometheus.io/download/
4. Using WGET command – Extract Node Exporter file to the respective servers
5. Extract using TAR command : root@ip-172-31-27-223:~# tar -xvzf node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
6. Navigate to node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64/ and start NODE EXPORTER PROCESS by below command
root@ip-172-31-27-223:~/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64# ./node_exporter &
7.Verify using <IP_ADDRESS:9100> - By default Node Exporter uses PORT 9100
Now we need to map NODE EXPORTER server to our PROMETHEUS server to fetch metrics under 
PROMETHEUS UI – (Refer STEP 8 in PROMETHEUS INSTALLATION - 3.135.194.87:9090) 
1. Login PROMETHEUS SERVER and navigate to /root/prometheus-2.29.1.linux-amd64
2. Open prometheus.yml file and add below details 
 - job_name: "Node_Exporter"
 # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
 # scheme defaults to 'http'.
 static_configs:
 - targets: ["18.188.90.25:9100"] ----→ IP_ADDRESS:9100
3.Stop PROMETHEUS PROCESS by Killing it 
ps -ef | grep prometheus
kill -9 <PID>
  
FINAL VERIFICATION can be done under TARGETS to see existing JOBS and SERVERS mapped
  
INSTALLATION OF GRAFANA
1. Login to PROMETHEUS server (or create a new server to avoid confusion)
2. Download latest version of Grafana from https://grafana.com/grafana/download
3. Select the version (8.1.1) and Edition as OPEN SOURCE and LINUX OS
4. Under Standalone Linux Binaries, you can find the commands to directly install in your Machine
5. Navigate to grafana-8.1.1/ and BIN directory and execute below command: 
root@ip-172-31-6-217:~/grafana-8.1.1/bin# ./grafana-server &
7.Cross verify in browser using IP Address of the Machine with Port# 3000
8. When you’re trying to login GRAFANA UI for the FIRST time – Enter Username and Password as ADMIN
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: admin
Once above credentials is entered, it will prompt for a NEW Password:
  
ADDING PROMETHEUS TO GRAFANA
1. Add DATASOURCE as PROMETHEUS
2. Add PROMETHEUS server with PORT# 9090 as http://3.135.194.87:9090/
3. Save and TEST the connection – It should display as below 
4. Import DASHBOARD to Visualise the METRICS from https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards
5. Once Dashboard is IMPORTED, check if the exact IP ADDRESS of NODE EXPORTER is popping up in the
